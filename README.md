## Disclaimer   
While a lot of thought and research has gone into building this interface, the logic behind displaying the actual availability of slots keeps on changing as per Govt's decisions. Although I strive to keep this software in sync with the latest updates, it is always recommended to refer to the Indian Govt's CoWin website (`https://www.cowin.gov.in/home`) for real-time data.
